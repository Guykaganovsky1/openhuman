/**
 * Route-table coverage for the connections / channels / flows / automation
 * surfaces.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, given `pages/__tests__/Connections.redirects.test.tsx`
 * already claims to cover two of these redirects:
 *
 * That file declares its **own** local `<TestRoutes>` copy of three routes and
 * renders that, so it asserts React Router's `<Navigate>` works rather than
 * asserting anything about this app's route table. Deleting `/skills` from
 * `AppRoutes.tsx` leaves it green. It also never inspects the landing URL,
 * which is the entire payload of the `/channels` redirect.
 *
 * This file mounts the REAL `AppRoutes` (same mocking pattern as
 * `AppRoutes.auth.test.tsx`) and asserts the landing `pathname + search`, so a
 * change to the route table is what makes it fail.
